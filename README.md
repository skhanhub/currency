# Currency Annalyser
This project contains a full stack application for analysing currency based on historical data. The application reads the data from a <b>json</b> file and filters it based on the 'from date' and 'to date' interval as well as currencies selected by the user. The application then analyses the data to find the best possible buy price, buy time, sell price, sell time and the profit for each one of the selected currencies. 

The application uses the following technologies:
- Backend: NodeJs with an ExpressJs server
- Frontend: ReactJs 
- Type Checking: Typescript

## Getting Started

```bash
cd ./server
npm install
npm start
```

The server runs on port `5000`.

There are three routes:
```
- http://localhost:5000/                - homepage
- http://localhost:5000/api/currencies  - accepts GET requests for retrieving all the unique currencies
- http://localhost:5000/api/profits     - accepts POST requests with fromDate, toDate and a list of currencies as post data
                                          e.g. {fromDate: '20180507', fromDate: '20180507', currencySelected: ['BTC', 'ETC']}
```

## Project Structure

### Overall Structure

1. The project is devided in to two main directories. 
2. The `server` directory contains the express server as well as all the helper classes.
3. The `client` directory contains the reactjs Frontend code.

### Server Structure

1. The `server/test` directory contains all the unit and integration tests for the Backend server.
2. The `server/src` directory contains the route handler, the main app.ts and services.
3. The `server/data` directory contains the currency data in a json format.
4. The `server/config` directory contains all the site specific configs.
5. The `server/dist` directory contains all compiled js files.
6. The `server/public` directory contains all the static files generated by webpack build.

### Client Structure

1. The `client/src/App.tsx` directory contains the root react component for the Frontend.
2. The `server/src/dateForm.tsx` directory contains the functional component for generating the form.
3. The `server/src/profitTable.tsx` directory contains the functional component for creating the profit tables.

## Development
